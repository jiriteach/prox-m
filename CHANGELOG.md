## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.4] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- **Installer**:
  - Fixed `sed` delimiter issue during uninstall that caused "extra characters after command" error (PR #6 by @jiriteach)
  - Root cause: Marker text `<!-- /ProxMorph JS Patches -->` contained `/` which conflicted with sed's default delimiter
  - Solution: Use `|` as alternate delimiter and properly escape special regex characters
- **UniFi Theme (v5.88)**:
  - Fixed "Finish Edit" checkmark button appearing on tags when not in edit mode
  - Root cause: `.x-btn-default-small { display: flex !important }` overrode Proxmox's inline `display: none`
  - Solution: Added rule to respect inline `display: none` styles for dynamically hidden buttons
  - Fixed dark text on tags in edit mode (e.g., teal `testesteste` tag had black text)
  - Tags now always use light text (#F9FAFA) when in edit mode, regardless of `proxmox-tag-dark` classification
  - Fixed "More" button position in IPs section not visible (was positioned off-screen)
  - Corrected transform value from -430px to -242px to align with current PVE 9.x layout

## [2.2.3] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Installer**:
  - Improved PVE version detection to report specific manager version (e.g., v9.1.4) instead of metapackage version (v9.1.0)
  - Suppressed misleading "Themes directory not found" error during one-liner (`curl | bash`) installations
  - Added robust guards for script path detection via `BASH_SOURCE`

## [2.2.2] - 2026-01-20

### Added
- **Proxmox Backup Server (PBS) Support**:
  - The installer now officially supports PBS (v3.x/4.x)
  - Auto-detects product (PVE or PBS) and adjusts paths automatically
  - Native integration with PBS theme selector
  - Persistence across PBS updates via apt hook
  - JavaScript patches support for PBS template format (.hbs)

## [2.2.1] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Apt Hook**:
  - Fixed `[[: not found` syntax error in `post-update.sh` by enforcing POSIX compliance (ensures compatibility with `dash`/`sh`)
- **GitHub Dark Theme**:
  - **Tree/Toolbox Highlights**:
    - Ported authentic UniFi highlight mechanism (using pseudo-elements) to fix "double background" and text artifacts
  - **Structural Alignment**:
    - Ported UniFi border structures (radius, padding, layout) to Windows, Panels, and Fieldsets while preserving GitHub colors
  - **Resource Tree**:
    - Removed default blue focus borders
    - Aligned cell padding with UniFi standards
- **UniFi Theme (v5.85)**:
  - Fixed horizontal scrollbar in resource tree (1px overflow caused by CSS specificity conflict)
  - Added scrollbar corner styling to eliminate white square artifact at corner intersection
- **UniFi Theme (v5.87)**:
  - Fixed "More" button position in IPs section of Summary panel for variable IP count
  - Button now correctly positioned next to "IPs" label regardless of whether 1, 2, or more IPs are displayed
  - Root cause: ExtJS dynamically sets button's `top` based on container height
  - Solution: Anchor to `top: 0` then use consistent transform for fine positioning
  - Added overflow:visible to parent containers to prevent clipping

### Added
- **UniFi Theme (v5.86)**:
  - Replaced sprite-based ExtJS tool icons with crisp FontAwesome icons:
    - Zoom out (undo zoom), collapse/expand panel chevrons
    - Maximize/restore window icons
    - Gear (settings) and refresh icons
  - Distinct icons for collapse vs expand states (chevron direction indicates action)
  - Added styling for generic inline FontAwesome tool icons (e.g., "Reset form data" button)
  - Fixed disabled tool icon mask overlay (transparent background, non-blocking pointer events)
- **Chart Hover Dots**:
  - Added subtle white border (1px) to chart data point dots when hovered
  - Improves visibility of hover state against colored fills

## [2.2.0] - 2026-01-18

### Added
- **JavaScript Chart Patching**:
  - Implemented `unifi-charts.js` to dynamically patch Proxmox RRD charts
  - Adds true UniFi color palette validation (Green/Blue) to charts
  - Solves "Network Traffic" chart blending issues by layering areas correctly
- **Installation**:
  - `install.sh` now installs JavaScript patches to `/usr/share/pve-manager/js/proxmorph/`
  - persistence across PVE updates via APT hook (post-update re-patching)

  - Removed padding reset that was eliminating the gap

## [2.0.1] - 2025-01-14

### Fixed
- Resource grid labels (Memory, Cores) no longer appear dark gray
